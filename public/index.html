I'm trying to push a file to a git repo of a friend but errors on public key.

git push origin testbranch
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Where and how do we define public / private keys?

git remote -v returns:

origin  git@github.com:Sesamzaad/NET.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:Sesamzaad/NET.git (push)
Any help is appreciated.

I was facing same problem and here is what I did that worked for me.

Use ssh instead of http. Remove origin if its http.

git remote rm origin
Add ssh url

git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<repo>.git
Generate ssh key inside .ssh/ folder. It will ask for path and passphrase where you can just press enter and proceed.

cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen
Copy the key. You can view your key using -

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
If you hadn't specified a different path then this will be the default path.

Add this key to your github account.

Next do -

ssh -T git@github.com
You will get a welcome message in your console.

cd into to your project folder. git push -u origin master now works! -->
